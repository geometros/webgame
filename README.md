Building a basic game to learn more about javascript and application development

to do:

*~~Prevent sprite from moving off screen - old school wraparound~~
*~~make the sprite something more interesting like a boat~~
*~~Make the boat sprite face direction of motion~~
*~~Fix boat jumping too far onto screen when wrapping around~~

~~*Make game loop use requestAnimationFrame instead of just a timer~~

~~*Add a dot to indicate player/beast coords to debug function~~
~~*Add cannonball firing~~
*~~Add a sea serpent~~

*Make a hitbox for the beast so it can be hit by cannonball
*Make hitbox for boat so it can be hit by spawning beast
*Make cannonball look like it's actually coming from side mounted cannon on boat
*Add hit animation for boat and beast
*Add waves
*Clean up functions so draw func only draws and entity movements are handled by wrangle func
*Fix beast spawns so it's not showing up off the canvas
*mashing WAD or ASD allows sideways movement, fix?
*Remove hardcoded pixel values for wrapping sprite at edges
*Make canvas size responsive
